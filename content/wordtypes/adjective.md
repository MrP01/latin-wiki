# Overview

Adjectives describe the state of objects or people. They are very similar to nouns, since the are not 
conjugated but declined. Thus, an adjective can either be singular or plural and be in one of the 6 cases.
This is neccessary, because an adjective is always in bound with a noun. For this, an adjective has to be 
in the same case and sex as the noun.

Adjectives usually refer to properties of [nouns](../noun).

# Declinations

Adjectives are declined identically to nouns of the same declination. This eases the process of identifying
bound pairs of nouns and adjectives.

# Comparisons

Sometimes certain obejcts need to be compars, e.g. which man is the strongest or which boat the biggest. 
This is done by building the **comparative** or the **superlative**. The comparative describes itself. It 
is used for comparing two objects who posses the same quality. The comparative has different endings for
neuter in nominative, accusative and vocative, both in plural and singular forms, than male and feminie.

If an object is e.g. the biggest or has the most of somehting, a superlative is utilized. In contrast to
comparatives, superlatives are absolute. They also have the same ending for all sexes, unlike 
the comparative.

There exist some adjectives that do not compare regulary. Most adjectives keep their stem for the
comparisons, but <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;color:#279c00">magnus</span>
has <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;color:#279c00">maior</span> as comparative
and <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;color:#279c00">maximus</span> as
superlative.
