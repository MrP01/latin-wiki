Just as many other languages, Latin also 'features' Nouns as part of its fun and rich grammar. In this lesson, or rather cheat sheet, we want you to quickly find what you need for your Latin studies.

A Noun is the name of a person, place, thing, or quality.

Nouns are either **Proper** or **Common**. Proper nouns are permanent names of persons or
places; as, *Caesar*, *Rōma*. Other nouns are Common: as, *penna*, *virtūs*.

There are three **Genders** in the Latin language - *Masculine*, *Feminine*, and *Neuter*.
Gender in Latin is either **natural** or **grammatical**. For a natural person (usually denoted by a *proper* noun), the natural sex is usually the same as the grammatical gender / sex.

There are six **Cases** in Latin -
​	**Nominative**, the Case of the Subject;
​	**Genitive**, Objective with of, or Possessive;
​	**Dative**, Objective with to or for;
​	**Accusative**, the Case of Direct Object;
​	**Vocative**, Case of Address;
​	**Ablative**, Objective with specific prepositions.
