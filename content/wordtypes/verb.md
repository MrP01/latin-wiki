# Overview

Verbs are a very important part of latin, as they describe actions. Like nouns, they
consist of a **stem** and an **ending**. The present-stem determines the *Conjugation* the verb 
belongs to. 

To precisely describe an action, a verb must not only be conjugated, but also adress
the time of the action and wether it is active or passive.

# Stems

Each verb has three stems. The present-stem, the perfect-stem and the participial-stem. The stems are used
to from various tenses, voices, persons, numbers and moods. Depending on the tense either the present-stem 
or the perfect-stem is used. The most common appearance of the participial-stem is in perfect participles 
and the perfect infinitive.

# Conjugations

The present-stem of a verb determines the conjugation it belongs to. This means that
conjugations are groups of verbs that are very *similar* in a certain way. For example all verbs in
a conjugation have the same endings.

# Tenses

The tense of a verb describes when an action took place and how long it lasted. A classic 
example would be the difference between Perfect and Imperfect. The perfect describes an action
in the past, that is completed, e.g. <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;color:#279c00">Veni, Vidi, Vici</span>
translates to <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;color:#279c00">He came, he saw, he won</span>.
All three actions are completed. In contrast, the Imperfect either describes an action that
started in the past and is still going on, or a repeating action, e.g. <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;color:#279c00">Orpheus et homines et animalia carminibus suis delectebat</span> translates to <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;color:#279c00">Orpheus delighted both the people and the animals with his tunes</span>.

In Latin there are 6 tenses:

|Tense       |Stem   |Type of action                                          |
|------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|
|Present     |present|currently happening                                     |
|Imperfect   |present|started in past and still ongoing, or a repeated action |
|Future      |present|going to happen                                         |
|Perfect     |perfect|happened long ago and completed                         |
|Pluperfect  |perfect|happened before another action in the past              |
|Future exact|perfect|happened before another action in the future            |
  

Depending on the tense, the endings are the same for all conjugations or grouped into various types. 
For some conjugations, the present and perfect stem are very similar. But for mixed and consonantic, all
verbs are irregular, meaning their present stem is very different from their perfect stem. A good 
dictionary should list both present and perfect stems, so although recommended, learning a lot of irregular
verbs is by no means neccessary.

# Voices

The voice of a verb describes whether an action is passive or active. An active action is performed by the
person. In contrast a passive action is performed to the person. The passive endings are the same for all 
conjugations, when the present-stem is used.
