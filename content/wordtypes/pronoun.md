A Pronoun is a word that indicates something without naming it. It stands *for* (**replaces**) a noun, hence the name *pro*-noun.

We distinguish multiple classes of pronouns

- Personal Pronouns
- Relative Pronouns
- Demonstrative Pronouns
- Reflexive Pronouns
- Interrogative Pronouns
- Intensive Pronouns
- Indefinite Pronouns
