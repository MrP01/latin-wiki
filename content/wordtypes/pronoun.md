A Pronoun is a word that indicates something without naming it. It stands *for* (**replaces**) a noun, hence the name *pro*-noun.

We distinguish multiple classes of pronouns

- Personal Pronouns
- Relative Pronouns
- Demonstrative Pronouns
- Reflexive Pronouns
- Interrogative Pronouns
- Intensive Pronouns
- Indefinite Pronouns

Here is an overview of the most commonly used pronouns you will need for translating basic Latin sentences:

## Relative Pronouns

Mainly used as part of relative sentences or subclauses, a relative pronoun serves the purpose of conjoining modifying information about an antecedent [referent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referent).
