A Pronoun is a word that indicates something without naming it. It stands *for* (**replaces**) a noun, hence the name *pro*-noun.

We distinguish multiple classes of pronouns

- Personal Pronouns
- Relative Pronouns
- Demonstrative Pronouns
- Reflexive Pronouns
- Interrogative Pronouns
- Intensive Pronouns
- Indefinite Pronouns

Here is an overview of the most commonly used pronouns you will need for translating basic Latin sentences:

## Demonstrative Pronouns

is, ea, id, eius, etc is undoubtedly the most commonly used demonstrative pronoun in Latin.
Just for reference, we also listed the others here :)

ille, illa, illud is a variation of is, ea, id;
quite a bit of similarity in the declination right? ;)

hic, haec, hoc is another irregular piece of vocabulary we all dearly love in Latin.
But it's used quite heavily, therefore: try to remember it.

Another declination variation: ipse, ipsa, ipsum, which roughly translates to "self" in Latin. It's also referred to as the reflexive pronoun.
Remembering the declination is not all too hard in this case.

## Relative Pronouns

Mainly used as part of relative sentences or subclauses, a relative pronoun serves the purpose of
conjoining modifying information about an antecedent [referent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referent).
